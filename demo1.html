      <p>Elliott Wood Partnership was established as a civil and structural engineering consultancy in London in 1994. Our ambition was to engineer buildings better.</p>
      <p> At its simplest level it was about working harder to understand and improve structures, using less materials, making the most efficient elegant solutions and being environmentally aware. This ethos has been followed for 30 years and we have made many things better across the UK. Today driven by technology and the fourth Industrial Revolution, we live in a different world. Economic, societal, health and environmental forces have changed all aspects of everyday life. In response we are changing our habits to allow us to focus on designing things better</p>
      <p>We are engineers and it is hugely important that we understand where things come from, how they fit together, their cost and how they work long term. This approach will help our clients and associates make better buildings and places for both society and the environment</p>
